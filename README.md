# Next.js 15 API Route Data Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application where data fetched from an API route is not correctly displayed on a client component. The API route functions as expected, returning a JSON response. However, the About page, which fetches this data, fails to render it.

## Bug Description

The About page uses `useEffect` and `fetch` to retrieve data from the `/api/hello` API route. While the API call completes successfully (verified via network inspection), the component's state does not update, resulting in the data not being rendered.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe that the data from the API route is not displayed, even though the API call is successful.

## Potential Causes

* **Asynchronous operations:** Issues with handling asynchronous operations within `useEffect`.
* **State updates:** Problems with correctly updating the component's state.
* **Component lifecycle:** Incorrect timing of state updates relative to the component lifecycle.

## Solution

The issue is likely related to the timing of state updates within the useEffect hook.  The solution might involve ensuring data fetching is handled correctly within the lifecycle method, or using alternative data fetching methods.  Also, check for potential race conditions if other asynchronous functions run concurrently.
